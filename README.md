My solutions of AOC 2021 in Go. Currently, learning Go so the 
solutions are probably not idiomatic or fast.

Built using:
- Go 1.17

Project structure built using [aocprep](https://github.com/charlesbourget/aocprep)

## How to run

> All command to be run in the project root

To run a single day simply run the following command :

```bash
go run ./dayXX
```

To run the tests for a single  run the following command :

```bash
go test ./dayXX
```

To run and time everything run [run-all.mjs](./scripts/run-all.mjs). You'll need Node >= 14.X.X and yarn.

```bash
cd scripts/
yarn install
yarn run-all
```
